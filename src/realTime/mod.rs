//! # Real-time API Module
//!
//! Provides real-time audio and video communication capabilities for the Zhipu AI API.
//! This module is designed for interactive applications that require low-latency
//! audio and video streaming.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Audio Streaming** - Real-time audio input and output
//! - **Video Streaming** - Real-time video input and output  
//! - **Low Latency** - Optimized for minimal communication delay
//! - **Interactive Communication** - Support for bidirectional audio/video calls
//!
//! ## Planned Capabilities
//!
//! Based on the project roadmap, this module will support:
//!
//! - Audio/video calling with AI models
//! - Real-time transcription and synthesis
//! - Interactive voice and video conversations
//! - WebRTC-based communication protocols
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//!
//! ⚠️ **Note**: This module is currently under development and APIs are not yet stable.
//! The implementation is planned for future releases.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Future usage example (API subject to change)
//! use zai_rs::realTime::*;
//!
//! let client = RealTimeClient::new(api_key);
//! let session = client.start_audio_session().await?;
//! ```
